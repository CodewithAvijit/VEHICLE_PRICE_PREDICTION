## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
```

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodewithAvijit/vehicle-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd vehicle-price-prediction
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended for dependency isolation):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `XGBoost`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset:**  
   Ensure that the dataset (`dataset.csv`) is in the appropriate directory as specified in the script.

2. **Run the prediction script:**  
   Execute the Python script to train the model and predict vehicle prices:

   ```bash
   python vehicle_price_prediction.py
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation:**  
   After running the script, the model will output the performance metrics for both the training and test datasets, as well as predicted vehicle prices for new data inputs.

## Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using both training and test datasets. Below are the key performance metrics:

- **Training Accuracy:** 99.5
- **Test Accuracy:** 89.1

These results demonstrate the model's high accuracy and its ability to generalize well to unseen data, making it reliable for real-world applications.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting vehicle prices. By leveraging advanced techniques such as label encoding and XGBoost regression, the model achieves robust performance with both high training and test accuracy. The project highlights the potential of machine learning to automate price estimation in the automotive industry, particularly for used car dealerships and online platforms.ss
